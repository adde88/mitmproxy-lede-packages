This directory contains the packages required to install all of mitmproxy's binary dependencies on [LEDE](https://lede-project.org/). All other dependencies, including mitmproxy, can then be installed with `pip3`.

The current state of the packages provided here is a mess: They compile (for MIPS and x64 targets at least), but that's about it. Descriptions/License Tags are wrong or missing, and some packages are old versions because they were adapted from the respective Python 2 package.

I am happy to accept contributions, but I do not provide support or maintenance for any of this. If you are interested in becoming a maintainer for this project, please reach out.
